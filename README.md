Hi, I’m **Alexandre Poggioli**, also known as **@Slinky802**.

I love programming, mainly in **Python** but also in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**.

I've created several games with Python and Pygame, and I recently completed new Python libraries : 

- **pyasciilib**, which lets you convert an image into ASCII text
  
- **pypostfix**, which lets you manipulate stacks and both infix and postfix (Reverse Polish Notation or RPN) expressions.

I am also learning to use some visual python libraries like PyQt5 to create UI applications.
