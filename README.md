Hi, I’m **Alexandre Poggioli**, also known as **@Slinky802**.

I love programming, mainly in **Python** but also in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**.

I've created several games with Python and Pygame, and I recently completed a new Python library : **pyascii**, which lets you convert an image into ASCII text.
I am also learning to use some visual python libraries like PyQt5 to create UI applications.
